Grace Strauss &amp; Margaret Kimery Final project 215
Instructions:
With up to one partner, you will need to research a modern web technology that has or will
not covered in class, deliver a tutorial-style presentation on this technology, and also create
a GitHub website which implements what you learned. The instructor will coordinate the
division of the features/examples to be used in the individual Web sites. You must get
approval from the instructor on your topic and plan for individual implementations.
o The presentation must be 10 minutes, and each presenter must talk for at least 4
minutes. Professional dress is required. Typo-free, tutorial style PPT slide set is
required. Your last two slide must include 3 questions and answers (no true/false or
yes/no questions) which are from the content of your presentation.
o Each student on the team must create a public website that demonstrates a feature/etc
or example project of the technology they are researching. Students on the team must
coordinate this effort so that websites don't overlap. Whatever you do, you must
implement it yourself, and so it can include (non-sensitive) content about you, your
degree program, or whatever.
o During the presentation, each student should demo their website and what they
implemented.
